# 👋 Hi, I'm Seshan

I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Puducherry Technological University, deeply passionate about research at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Neuroscience**, and **Human-AI Collaboration**.

🔬 My research focuses on **augmenting human potential** through brain-inspired AI systems, assistive technologies, and multimodal machine learning for early diagnosis and cognitive support.

💡 Currently, I'm:
- 🧠 Leading my thesis project: **FALCON-AI**, a real-time diagnostic framework using 3D Swin Transformers and neuroanatomical rules for Alzheimer's diagnosis.
- 🧪 Working on lightweight, edge-deployable **multimodal AI systems** for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using EEG and clinical data.
- 📝 Authoring a book titled *"Thinking Like a Brain"* — an exploration of brain-inspired AI and the future of human-AI synergy.

📚 I've contributed to research projects across premier institutes like **IISc**, **JIPMER**, and **NIT Trichy**, with 5+ research papers (published or submitted) and multiple interdisciplinary collaborations.
